# Scrolling Binary Matrix display

Aim of the project is to display scrolling binary data from an input pin, on a SK9822 8x8 matrix display,
for example https://coolcomponents.co.uk/products/led-flexible-matrix-8x8-80mm-x-80mm-sk9822-adafruit-dotstar-compatible

Also functions on an iCEstick FPGA Evaluation Kit with 3.3V to 5V logic level converter.

## Animation
